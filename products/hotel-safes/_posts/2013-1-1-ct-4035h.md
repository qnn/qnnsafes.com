**Keys:**Some safes require a <a href="http://www.protexsafe.com/Articles.asp?ID=319" target="_blank">key</a> to open and some safes have an <a href="http://www.protexsafe.com/Articles.asp?ID=320" target="_blank">emergency key override</a>:

We can duplicate keys using serial number

**External Battery Box****:**Some safe are equipped with the power override feature which allows to provide power from the outside of the safe into the locking mechanism in order to open the safe and replace the batteries:

The external battery box opens the safe only if the correct code is used. The external battery box does not compromise the security of the safe.

It is not recommended to leave batteries inside the external battery box for more than few weeks.

Do not operate your safe with only the external battery box. This device is intended to help you gain access to the safe in order to change the batteries.
